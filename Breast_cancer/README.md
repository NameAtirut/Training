This script primarily implements the novel low-code ML library (PyCaret) to compare the resulting accuracy, flexibility, customisability, 
and reproducibility of the method.

Techniques used:

  - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
  - Data Pre-processing: One-hot Encoding
  - Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
  - (Primary) Data Visualisation
  - (Primary) Hyperparameter Fine-Tuning
